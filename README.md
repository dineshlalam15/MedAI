📌 RAG-Powered Document Chatbot using LangChain & OpenAI

📝 Description:
- This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, or other formats) and interact with them via a conversational interface. It uses LangChain for orchestration, FAISS for vector storage, and OpenAI GPT models for natural language understanding.

⚡ Features:
- 📂 Document Ingestion: Upload and process multiple documents into embeddings.
- 🔍 Efficient Retrieval: Uses FAISS vector store for semantic search.
- 💬 Conversational Q&A: Ask context-aware questions based on your documents.
- ⚙ Customizable Pipelines: Easily swap out models, embeddings, or vector DBs.
- 🐍 Python Based: Simple to run locally or deploy to the cloud.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python 3.10+
- LangChain
- OpenAI GPT API
- FAISS Vector Store
- PyPDF2 / Unstructured / Chroma (optional)
