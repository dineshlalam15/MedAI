This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to upload documents (PDFs, text, or other formats) and interact with them via a conversational interface. It uses LangChain for orchestration, FAISS for vector storage, and OpenAI GPT models for natural language understanding.
